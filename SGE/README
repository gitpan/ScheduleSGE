SGE Modules

These are light-weight modules designed to submit jobs to the Sun Grid Engine, and query the status of the engine. There are more comprehensive modules available in DRMAA. The alternate module, DRMAA, relies on Swig and a bunch of C code. This is a pure perl implementation of an interface to SGE. The required commands are qsub, qdel, and qstat that should be supplied by SGE.

Environment Variables

The following environment variables should probably be set. The values below are the defaults for my system, an Orion cluster
	SGE_CELL		=>  "orionmulti"
	SGE_EXECD_PORT		=>  537
	SGE_QMASTER_PORT	=>  536
	SGE_ROOT		=>  /opt/sge


These are set at the beginning of SGE.pm

There are currently four modules, SGE that is the glue, SGE::Run allows you to submit jobs to the SGE. SGE::Control for starting/stopping/deleting jobs, and SGE::Status for seeing what the cluster is currently up to. You should be able to use SGE; in your script and have all methods available to you.

Methods should be documented with perldoc.

This has only been tested on an Orion 12-node desktop cluster. I would be happy to crash test it on any other clusters, just give me a login or send me a cluster to use.
